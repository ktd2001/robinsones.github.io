I work at DataCamp as a Data Scientist on the growth team helping build out their A/B testing system. Previously, I was a Data Analyst at Etsy working with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features. I hold a Master's degree in Management (specialization in Organizational Behavior) from INSEAD, where I did research on women in STEM. I also earned my bachelor's degree from Rice University in Decision Sciences with a minor in Statistics. I'm passionate about helping people break into and succeed in data science (especially underrepresented groups), teaching the tidyverse, A/B testing, and making the R community welcoming and inclusive. In my spare time, I enjoy bringing down the mean age of a bridge game by a few decades, spending too much time on twitter, and looking at dogs Iâ€™m not able to adopt on PetFinder.
